- Wabi-sabi aesthetic with deliberate imperfections

## Image Prompt for Generation
Use this prompt in your image generation tool:

"Minimalist abstract composition on deep charcoal textured background, featuring a single enso circle drawn with rough, imperfect brushstrokes in muted gold-grey, partially intersected by thin geometric golden ratio spirals that fade into the darkness, subtle texture like weathered stone or aged paper, tiny neural network patterns barely visible in the deepest shadows, overall feeling of ancient wisdom meeting precise mathematics, wabi-sabi aesthetic with deliberate imperfections, extremely minimal with large areas of negative space, earthier tones of slate, charcoal, and stone with hints of warm grey-gold where light emerges, 1080x1080 pixels, high quality"
